# Malware-Report
Hello my name is VÅ©. This is my small project to learn about Malware Analysis.

For the malwares:
	+ brbbot.exe
	+ getdown.exe
	+ svchost.exe
I practiced analysis in the textbook's Lab FOR610 | REVERSE-ENGINEERING MALWARE: MALWARE ANALYSIS TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES.

For the malwares 
	+ BadRabbit 
I analysised about the spreading ways, some signatures and demo how it spreads via SMB protocol.

About the sample:
	+ Malwares in the textbook: from my professor
